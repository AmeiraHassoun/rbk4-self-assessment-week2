## Algorithm Complexity
* [ ] List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic complexity. Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
* [ ] What time complexity do the given functions have (with respect to the specified input)?

Types of algorithmic complexity:

-Big O(1): constant;
-O (log n)
-O (n): linear;
-O(n^2)
-O(n^n)
