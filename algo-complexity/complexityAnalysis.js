// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.

/*
1-constant O(1): no matter how is the length of the array
it takes just one time iterating over it. 

2-linear O(n):it itrait over the array element by element like in array has one forloop
 to find the smolist element;

3-quadratic O(n^2):it has tow forloops inside each other and it itrait over every
 element in the array two times that's mean duplicated time complexity;
 
4-log(n):it divide the data to two pieces and itrait over one peac like in binarysearchtree
