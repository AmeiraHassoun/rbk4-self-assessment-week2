    the time complexity is a measure the average of how much of operations do we need to do in our function 
    and it is arranged to 5 types 
    O(1):this means that the operations time is constant 
    O(n): this means that the number of operations is increasing by lenier line 
    O(n2): this means that the operations number increasing in a big way
    O(log n) increase by litle amount
    O(e) this type is increasing by huge amount
