Time complixity is used to count number of operations used in an algorithm. Long time occurs when we use many loops that rely on the input size.

Constant time  O(1) : This represents one operation

logarithimc O(log n) : When the operations get reduced  each time according to the size of the input. 

Linear O(n) : This is happen if the alrogthim contains a one loop over the input size

Linear logarithimic O(nlog n) : larger than a linear time

Square  O(n^2) : Two loops  over the inpur size

Quadratic  O(n^3) : three loops over the input size

exponential O(2^n): when time goes exponentionaly over the input size
