*/ 
//the retrieve function has O(n)linear time complexity, because it has a for loob that mean its O(n)linear.
//the sortedArrayContainsItem function has O(1) Constant, becuase there's no for loob or anything insde the functtion!, that's why its O(1) Constant.
//the hasDuplicates function its also O(n)linear, becuase its also has a for loob that mean its O(n)linear.
