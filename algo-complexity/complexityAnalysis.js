/*
	1-O(1)-constant ,it means we specify exactly where we want to go without using iteration or something.
	2-O(n)-linear ,it means we will iterate of the loop n times maybe in the first of the loop or in the middle or in the last
	3-O(n^2)-sqaure ,it means we have nested loop in the iteration will be N*N times
	4-O(lg n)-logarithm ,it mean when usin like the binary search 
	5-O(n^n)-exponantial, it means
