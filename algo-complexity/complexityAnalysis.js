// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
- constante O(1) lest say its one operation.
- O(n) this will be excuted n times in the worst case.
- log n this will be excuted n / 2 times .
- O(n^2) time complixity is high becase this code will excuted n * n times .
