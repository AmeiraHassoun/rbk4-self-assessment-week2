/*
** big o notation used to describe the algorithmic time complexity
1- constant O(1) , the algorithim need one operation to be calculated. ex. retriving from specific index in array.
2- linier O(n), the algorithim need same number of entries to be calculated, ex, find an item in array.
3- quadium O(n^2) , the algorithim need 2 dimentional loop to be calculated, so for each item will loop on all items. ex print diagonal in matrix.
4- exponantial O(n^n), it is the worst case when you need to have numper of iterations same as the number of items.
