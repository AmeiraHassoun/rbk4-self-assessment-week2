// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
O(1): The optimal time complexity, since it is constant regardless of the size of the input
O(log(n)): like in searching a sorted array for an item, it depends on the input, but it decreases 
slowly with larger input.
O(n^2): It is a bad complexity, when the time will increase dramatically with large input. 
O(c^n): Here, you don't need large input to increase time comlexity, the sharp increase 
will be significant in no time.
