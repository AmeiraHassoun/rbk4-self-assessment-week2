// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.

// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1-const (O(1)) when  return any value i want quickly such as i want to return the first element or when i want to delete number  
2- O(n) when  used iterator
3- O(n^2) when used nested iterator..
4 O(lon(n)) when used binary search
