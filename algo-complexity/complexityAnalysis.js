// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.

*/
//1. O(1)=> it is constant (best case), that means the input wont affect the time complexity every time an example of it to insert a key in the hash table .
			//- input 10= 1second
			//- input 100= 1second 
//2. O(log n)=> it is the logarthmic time complexity , an example of it the binarysearch the input affects in logarthimc way (half the time )
				// input 1= 1second
				// input 10= 2second
				// input 100= 3second 
//3. O(n)=> linear time complexity, the item or the input affects the time in a linear way like to itreat over the for loop to compare between the largest number 
                 // input 1= 1second
                 // input 10= 10second
                 // input 100= 100second

 //4. O(n^2)=> quadratic it is an example to iterate ove an nested for loops that mean the time will increase n*n

 				// input 1= 1second
 				//input 10= 100second
 				// input 100 = 10000second
//5. O(c^n)=>exponantial the worst case for the time complexity an example of it to giss the character for a long password
