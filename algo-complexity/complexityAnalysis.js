algorithmic time complexity is the number of operation in the code tha that the processor has 
to go through if the worst case happend, its types are: 
O(1):example: array retrieval method; constant time; which means that the code has a limited number of operations that don't depend on the number of elements.
O(n): array adding new element method; linear time with regard to the number of elements which means that the code has a number of operations that  depend on the number of elements in a linear way.
O(logn):example: binary search; logarithmic time with regard to the number of elements which means that the code has a number of operations that  depend on the number of elements in a logarithmic way.
O(nlogn):example: merge sort; (n times log n )time with regard to the number of elements which means that the code has a number of operations that  depend on the number of elements in linear times logarithmic way.
O(n^2): example: bubble sort; quadratic time with regard to the number of elements which means that the code has a number of operations that  depend on the number of elements in a quadratic way.
O(c^n): exponential time (constant to the power n) regard to the number of elements which is one of the worst cases
 which means that the code has a number of operations that  depend on the number of elements in an exponential way.
