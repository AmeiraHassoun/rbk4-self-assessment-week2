Ans. : the algorithmic complexity depend on how many functions and operations you need to make your code run ,, the answer it is realited to the time Complexity , too.

Time Complexity :: 
1/ If we only return a statement for a code , then the function is constant and the big O will be O(1) ,, which is the best case at time complexity
2/ the 2nd case ,, when we have function with an " operation or line " that gives us a linear result ,, then the time complesity will increase and the big O will be O(n).
3/ 3rd ,, when i have a function that gives me at the begning values with large diffrences ,, and then stay simi-constant ,, the big O will O(log) ,, ex. : at the log function ,, the diffrence between log(0) and log(1) larger than the diffrence between log(10) and log (100) ,, that is we call this case O(log)
4/ 4th and the worst when i have multipule operations with multipule elements ,, the big O will be now O(n^2) or O(n^n),, how many the power of n increse the time complexity will be in worst case
