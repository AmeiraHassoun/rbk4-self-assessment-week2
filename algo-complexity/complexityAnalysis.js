// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1 - Big-O(1) : it's instant no changes on the memory  , like a return , best case 
2 - Big-O(logn) : this when not that big changes on the memory  , like the if statment 
3 - Big-O(n)  :it's constant make some changes on the memory  , like the one for loop , you need to go over every elemnt 
4 - Big-O(n2) : this when has a hevely changes on the memory and take some times , like a two nisted for loop  , it take much time to loop in every elemnt inside it
5 - Big-O(con) : this is the worst in them it may freze your device and take the most time in them , so try to avoid it , this the bad case
