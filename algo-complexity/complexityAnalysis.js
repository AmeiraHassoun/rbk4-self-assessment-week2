// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
O(1)when we don't repeat the code like hash table 
O(n)when we use loop one time 
O(n^2)when we use Recursion or nested loop
O(2n^2)
O(log n)



more number of Operations that should computer meke mean the complexity will be more
