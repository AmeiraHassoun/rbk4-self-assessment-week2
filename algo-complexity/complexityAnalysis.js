1-Constant time complexity:O(1) has a constant time to excute any number of operations and is independent on any parameters such as the length of an array,for example the item lookup in an array complexity is always constant,and this is considered the best case senario.

2-O(Log(n)) time complexity:such time complexity is dependent on the number of operations but the time is less the more operations are executed,an example on Log(n) complexity would be the binary search function,although not as good as constant time complexity,its considered to be favorable.

3-O(n2) quadratic time complexity:is when time increases by n^2 in for an n number of operations ,such as 2 nested for-loops,this is not idea time complexity.

4-O(C ^ n) time complexity: is when time increases exponentially with respect to number of operations,this is considered the worst case senario.
