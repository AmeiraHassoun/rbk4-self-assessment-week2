/*
time complexity depend on how many time we use the condition or the loop .. 
and as long as the time is smaller it will be faster and better than the big time ..
so when it is O(1) ,, its go to spesific item and do the edit or the return to it ..
and when it is O(n) ,,its go throw the loop or the condition in all element ,,
and when it is O(n^2) ,, it is go throw throw the elements more than one time or when there 
is two loops or two conditions
