// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*

1-constant Complexity : we need only one operation in this case to complete our function and retrieve the result.
2-linear complexity : we need to execute n operations to complete our functions and retrieve the result.
3- log n complexity : we need to execute (log n) operations to complete our functions and retrieve the result.
4- square n complexity:  we need to execute (square n) operations to complete our functions and retrieve the result.
