// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.

/*
1.constat: where the answer is not related to n so the instructions will always be excuted once or without loop "this is the best complexity"
2.O(log(n)) more complex than constat but less than n
2:O(n) or linear where the instructions will be excuted n times  
3:O(n log(n)) 
4:O(n^2) :the complexity is very high when you have nested loops 
5(O(n^n)) this is so complex  :)
