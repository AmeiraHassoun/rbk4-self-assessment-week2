The algorithmic time complexity is usually defined as the Big O, the Big O
is an expression to show the time taken for the code snippet to run.
The priotiy is to find out and write the most optimized code possible to have
fast and no time consuming code.
The types of Big O notations are the following:

O(n) - This time complexity is constant of which the code runs in constant time
O(n^2) - this notation is doubled time of which there is a double loop or more in a function
O(log(n)) - There is more than 3 expressions going at the same time making the time take longer than usual.
