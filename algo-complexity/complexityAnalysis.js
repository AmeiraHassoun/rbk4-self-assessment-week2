// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.

/*
from the best to last :
1)counstant time complexity its the best case when not need loob for examble
 return the first item in array or return the last item in array 
2)logratimic time complex O(log) in this case we search in half of array 
and ignore the half for examble binary search
3) linear time complexity O(n) this when we need to visit all item in the array for example map function
4)O(n^2) when we have nested for loop
5)O(c^n) c is counstant
