// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment

/*
type1:
constant is the ideal case at all because it won't matter if you have small or big data the time is constant 
type2:
linear is good but only for small data, this happen when the realation between the length of your array and the 
no.Of instructions are correlated with each other 
type3:
quadratic n^2 this happen when you have two loop and this is so awful for big problem 
type 4L 
logaritmic logn this what I mentioned in the binary search algorithm 
Note:
if our complexity was n^2+n we ignore the small changes we consider only the big change
