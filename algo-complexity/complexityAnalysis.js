// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1-constant time which is the amount of operations that needs to be done is the same no matter what is the input
2-linear time which is doing operations on all the inputs whch is the N 
3-log n ( forgot the name ) its an algorithim that reduce the amount of the input like in binary search tree . each time dividin by 2 
4-n^n ( also forgot the name ) its the worst because it grows alot depending on the size of the input an example of it is nested loops
