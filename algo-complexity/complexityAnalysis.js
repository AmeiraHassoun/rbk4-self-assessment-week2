// List and briefly describe the types of algorithmic time complexity.
// Be as clear and complete as necessary to demonstrate your mastery.
// Write your explanation below as a comment
/*
1- Constant complexity: it is happen when we have just normal instruction that is take the same time no matter what the size of the input is it always give you the result in constant time.
2- Algoratimic complexity: when we decrease the input into the half every time, and when the input get really really big the time increase slightly.
3- exponent complexity: when the operations happen throw naseted loops depend on the input, so when the input get slightly bigger the time get really really big.
4- linear complexity: when the operations goes throw one loop so the time increase constantly according to the input size.
