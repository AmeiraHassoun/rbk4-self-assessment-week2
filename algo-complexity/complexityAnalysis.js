// Problem 1: Retrieval of a value from a hash table using the following function with regard to the size of the hash table.

/*
 Complexity:
 */

/*-This function has [O(n) complexity], because [we have one for loop] means [Retrieval of a value from a hash table using the following function with regard to the size of the hash table]




// Problem 2: sortedArrayContainsItem with regard to the length of the passed-in array

/*
 Complexity:
 */
/*-This function has [O(n*n) complexity], because [we used recurtion] means [sortedArrayContainsItem with regard to the length of the passed-in array]
*/




// Problem 3: hasDuplicates with regard to the length of the passed in array

/*
 Complexity:
 */
/*-This function has [O(n) complexity], because [we have one for loop] means [hasDuplicates with regard to the length of the passed in array]
